# Astrology Birth Chart Calculator with Planetary Harmonics

An advanced birth chart calculator that combines traditional astrological analysis with cutting-edge **Planetary Harmonics Theory** - a revolutionary framework that bridges rigorous astronomical computation with sophisticated astrological interpretation.

## ✨ New Features: Planetary Harmonics Sidebar

### What is Planetary Harmonics Theory?

Planetary Harmonics Theory is a groundbreaking approach to astrological computation that utilizes **base-12 circular logic** as a multi-dimensional system for modeling emotional and cosmic patterns. Unlike linear logic systems, circular logic naturally models the cyclical, resonant patterns inherent in emotional and cosmic influences.

### Key Components

#### 🌌 Cosmic Forces (6 Fundamental Forces)
The theory derives six cosmic forces from elemental combinations:

- **Core** (Fire + Earth): Concentration, singularity, manifestation
- **Void** (Water + Air): Expansion, matrix space, potential  
- **Order** (Air + Earth): Structure, linear progression, organization
- **Chaos** (Fire + Water): Dynamic transformation, wave motion, change
- **Alpha** (Fire + Air): Initiation, beginning, ascent
- **Omega** (Earth + Water): Completion, ending, descent

#### 🎵 Harmonic Analysis
Each planet generates 12 harmonic frequencies based on its orbital period:
- Base frequency calculated from orbital mechanics
- 12 harmonic overtones with natural 1/n amplitude decay
- Phase relationships create interference patterns
- Synodic periods determine conjunction/opposition cycles

#### ⚛️ Quantum Emotional Mechanics  
The system models emotions as quantum-like phenomena in 15-dimensional Hilbert space:
- 15 dimensions from pairwise cosmic force relationships
- Complex amplitude states with base-12 quantized phases
- Emotional resonance calculations between states
- Time evolution through Hamiltonian operators

#### 📐 15-Dimensional Space Navigation
Maps all possible relationships between cosmic forces:
- C(6,2) = 15 unique dimensional coordinates
- Each dimension represents force pair interactions
- Weight calculations based on planetary positions
- Harmonic convergence analysis

#### 🔄 Synodic Period Analysis
Calculates real astronomical relationship cycles:
- Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions (~20 years)
- Venus-Mars cycles
- All planetary pair combinations
- Great conjunction predictions
